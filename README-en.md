# Code-Fast

The objective of this project is to create an open-source, free, and beginner-friendly tutorial for data structures and algorithms. The book uses animated illustrations, making the content clear and easy to understand, with a smooth learning curve that guides beginners through the knowledge map of data structures and algorithms. The source code can be run with one click, helping readers improve their programming skills while understanding the working principles of algorithms and the underlying implementation of data structures. Additionally, it encourages mutual learning among readers, where questions and comments usually receive responses within two days.

## Project Background

Many beginners encounter the following issues during problem-solving practice:

1. Not knowing where to start solving problems
2. Finding problems that are not suitable for their current learning stage
3. Lacking high-quality solutions for reference

To address these issues, we have organized a detailed problem-solving sequence, including classic and frequently asked interview questions. Moreover, we provide detailed explanations for each problem, helping readers better understand and master the concepts.

## How to Use the Code-Fast Project

Start from arrays according to the problem-solving sequence below. Each topic includes theoretical foundation and summary sections to aid better learning and review.

```markdown
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Hash Tables
4. Strings
5. Stacks and Queues
6. Trees
7. Backtracking
8. Greedy Algorithms
9. Dynamic Programming
10. Graph Theory
11. Advanced Data Structures
```

## Project Advantages

The Code-Fast project offers more advantages than traditional methods like leetcode-master and hello-algo:

1. **Combined Advantage**: Code-Fast combines the extensive problem set of leetcode-master with the beginner-friendly approach of hello-algo, making it suitable for both newcomers and experienced programmers.

2. **Structured Approach**: The project provides a detailed learning roadmap, guiding users on what to learn and in what order, reducing the overwhelming feeling often associated with open platforms.

3. **High-Quality Solutions**: Each problem comes with detailed, easy-to-understand solutions, often accompanied by illustrations or even videos, ensuring that users not only solve problems but also understand the underlying principles.

4. **Community Support**: Users can engage in discussions and feedback within a supportive community, ensuring quick resolutions and diverse perspectives on problem-solving methods.

5. **Language Variants**: Unlike some other platforms, Code-Fast encourages contributions in multiple programming languages, making it accessible to a wider audience based on their language preferences.

## Preparing for Blue Bridge Cup and ACM Algorithm Competitions

Preparing for algorithm competitions like the Blue Bridge Cup and ACM requires an organized approach and thorough understanding of key data structures and algorithms. Here are some steps to help you prepare effectively:

1. **Understand the Competition Format and Rules**: Get familiar with the rules, allowed programming languages, and common types of problems encountered in the competition.

2. **Review Basic Knowledge**: Ensure your foundation in data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables) and algorithms (sorting, searching, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms) is solid.

3. **Advanced Concepts**: After mastering the basics, move on to more advanced topics such as dynamic programming techniques, tree traversal strategies, graph algorithms, and advanced data structures.

4. **Practice with Real Problems**: Practice a wide range of problems by category and difficulty level using platforms like Code-Fast. This will help you identify your strengths and weaknesses.

5. **Simulate Competition Conditions**: Try solving problems under the actual time constraints of competitions. This will improve your speed and accuracy under pressure.

6. **Review and Reflect**: Thoroughly review solutions after practicing each problem and understand different approaches. Participate in community discussions and alternative solutions.

7. **Participate in Online Programming Competitions**: Join virtual competitions to get a feel for the actual competition environment. Websites like Codeforces, Topcoder, and LeetCode offer such opportunities.

8. **Review Recent Problems**: As the competition date approaches, focus on solving recent competition problems. This will help you understand trends and difficulty levels in the problems.

9. **Rest and Strategize**: Before the competition, ensure you have good rest and plan your strategy. Know when to switch between problems and manage your time effectively.
